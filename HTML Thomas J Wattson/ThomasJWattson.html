        Thomas J. Watson was a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing equipment used today by business,
        government, science and industry. He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at <br> <br>

        Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in
        Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and musical instruments before
        joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually worked his way up to general
        sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which
        later became a widely known symbol of IBM. <br><br>

        Throughout his life, Mr. Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations. He adopted for IBM the
        slogan, "World Peace Through World Trade," worked closely with the International Chamber of Commerce and in 1937
        <br>
        was elected its president. For many years Mr. Watson served as a trustee of Columbia University and Lafayette
        College. He was presented with honorary degrees by 27 colleges and universities in the United States and four
        abroad. <br> <br>

        Mr. Watson was named chairman in September 1949. A month before his death on June 19, 1956, Mr. Watson handed
        over the reins of the company to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr. Another son, Arthur K. Watson, served as
        president of IBM World Trade Corp., the company's international operations.
